        <h1> Background </h1>
            AutoHotkey (ahk) is amazingly powerful and you could write a script that could automate your computer to do anything from play chess to design a space-ship. (This is not a balanced or objective view. This author is a huge fan of ahk.)
    That said, sometimes we just want to cut-n-paste and then play with the code until we understand enough to be dangerous, (rather than fully understanding.)

        For those that would rather know enough to be useful I've included a well commented <a href="/AutoHotkeyCookbook/examples/boilerplate_example.html">example</a> that contains the defaults that I use.

        <h3> Presumptions, Defaults and choices</h3>
        <h4> Editor: Notepad++</h4>
            The first thing that I did, after glimpsing the true power of AutoHotkey was to do <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/27988-edit-this-script-with-notepad/#post_id_582019">roughly what techturtle suggested</a>. This sets Notepad++ as the default editor for AutoHotkey.
    
    <ol>
        <li> run regedit
        <li> Find HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\AutoHotkeyScript\Shell\Edit\Command
        <li> modify the value to be
        <pre>
            notepad++.exe %1
        </pre>
    </ol>
    This works on Windows 7.
        <h4>Not everyone wants salt in their porridge</h4>
            Where possible in the cut-n-paste examples, I've limited it to the function being demonstated. In most cases you will probably want to combine it with other functions or features.
